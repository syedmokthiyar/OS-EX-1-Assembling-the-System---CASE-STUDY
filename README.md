# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY

### AIM:
To assembling the system
### Material required :
• Case
• Motherboard
• Central Processing Unit(CPU)
• Solid State Drive (SSD)
• Graphics Processing Unit(GPU)
• CPU Cooling System
• Random Access Memory(RAM)
• Thermal Paste
• Power Supply Unit (PSU)
• Phillips Screwdriver
• Hard Drive (Optional)
• Additional cooling systems(Optional)
### PROCEDURE:
## 1:Installing Motherboard/ Central Processing Unit (CPU)
• Unlatch the CPU housing and avoid touching the golden contact points.

• Gently grab the CPU avoiding the golden pins on the back side. Carefully place the CPUin the housing in the correct orientation which should be marked with a symbol ornotches which are on both the CPU and motherboard. This should fit easily and shouldn’tneed to be forced in the socket.

• After the CPU is in the housing, close the latch on the housing. This part may need to be forced and some motherboards come with a plastic piece that will pop off the front once closed, this part should be saved.

## 2:Applying Thermal Paste/ Installing the cooling system
• After the CPU is installed apply a pea-sized amount of thermal paste directly in the center of the front of the CPU. If too much is applied, it will spill over and this can be cleaned with rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab/ paper towel.

• After the paste is applied view the instructions that come with the cooling system to finish installation as all cooling systems differ based on the type of cooling being used.

• Plug in the cooling system into the motherboard that is labeled ‘CPU fan’ or ‘CPU fan header’ to power the system, if an all-in-one system is being used there should be a place labeled ‘AIO pump’ to plug a second cable in to.

## 3:Installing the Solid-State Drive (SSD)
• This step requires you to find the contact points, which should be easily found by looking at the motherboard’s manual.

• After the SSD is plugged in you will want to secure it with the screw that is provided, this may require a small

## 4:Installing the Random-Access Memory (RAM)
• Before installing make sure the clamps that house the RAM are open.

• Align the RAM sticks so they correspond with the breakpoints on the motherboard, avoid touching the golden contact points. This shouldn’t have to be forced and should fit with ease.

• Once installed close the clamps that house the RAM to secure. Refer to the motherboard’s manual for optimal placement of RAM.

## 5:Installing input Output shield (I/O shield)
• Before installing align with your motherboard so it is in the correct orientation with the ports. The I/O shield should come with your motherboard.

• Then place into the case in the correct orientation which should match with the placement of your motherboard. This part will most likely have to be forced into position but it is important to get it secure so the motherboard doesn’t fall out in the upcoming steps.

## 6:Installing the motherboard into the case
• Remove both side panels on the case and place them in a safe place with the screws

• Once the interior is visible tuck away the cords, so the installation is more manageable.

• Most cases have a noticeable place to place the motherboard, usually noticeable by at least the screw-holes that correspond to the holes along the side of the motherboard. • Once putting the board in the correct orientation matching the input output shield as discussed in the previous step, secure the board with the provided screws but make sure to not screw them too tightly to avoid damaging the motherboard. The motherboard should be budging once installed.

## 7: Installing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
Remove as many barrier slots as you need depending on the size of your GPU. These slots are located on the outside of the case between the input output shield and the back of the PSU. These may have to be unscrewed or just removed with force depending on the case.

• Gently pick up the GPU and avoid touching the golden contact points.

• Align the GPU with the PCI lane which is on the motherboard and should be running horizontally and be next to the shields previously removed.

• This should be placed without much force and once placed if you removed screws from the slots the screws should be replaced to secure the GPU. • If your GPU has a cord to connect power, plug that into the corresponding slot into the PSU

## 8: Installing the power supply unit (PSU)
• Slide the PSU into the designated location and make sure the fan is oriented pointing outside the case.

• Use the screws provided to lock the PSU into the correct place.

You will have to connect the cords into the corresponding outlets which should be labeled.

• To connect all switches and USB ports you will have to pull out the cords that were tucked away in step 6.

• Inspect each cord to find the corresponding port on the motherboard.
